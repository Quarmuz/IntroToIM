EDIT: the documented code was uploaded. The README file will be updates soon

Sorry for being late with deliverables. The code works (for me), but is an encyclopedic example of inconsistency,
unintuitional variable naming, bad OOP patterns and mixing several styles. Also - it lacks documentation.

Testing and optimising the game took much more time than anticipated, thus I am still working on making the code
somewhat readable. I mean, I can read it, but that's not the point.

One of the issues is, since I had very limited time, instead of starting from scratch I developed on the existing project
from June 3, without applying OOP changes I suggested myself (I really SHOULD HAVE done it on the decorator design pattern!).

Anyways. I have a working project and I am presenting it in class. I hope to tidy the code up promptly.

Also - the self-amplifying collissions still have not been resolved :(
